"""Generate `shell/crates/shell-text/src/unicode_tables.rs` from Python's `unicodedata`.

    gen_unicode_tables.py > ../shell/crates/shell-text/src/unicode_tables.rs

The tokenizer needs four things that Rust's standard library does not expose:

  * `\\p{L}`, `\\p{M}`, `\\p{N}` -- the Qwen2 pre-tokenizer splits on these general
    categories, and `char::is_alphabetic()` is *not* `\\p{L}`: it is the Alphabetic
    property, which also includes `Nl` (Roman numerals) and part of `Mn`.
  * canonical decomposition, combining classes and composition pairs, for NFC.

These are generated rather than pulled from a crate so the build stays offline and
the tables can be inspected and regenerated. `unicodedata.unidata_version` is
recorded in the output: a codepoint assigned in a later Unicode version than this
table will be classified as "other", which is the only way this can drift.

The tables are stored as ranges where the property is a pure set membership
(`L`, `M`, `N`), and as sorted `(key, value)` slices where a codepoint maps to a
value. Hangul syllables (U+AC00..U+D7A3, 11172 codepoints) carry an algorithmic
decomposition per UAX #15 and are excluded: they would otherwise be 85% of the
table for no information.
