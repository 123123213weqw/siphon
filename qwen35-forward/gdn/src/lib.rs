//! Gated delta net (`Qwen3_5GatedDeltaNet`) — the linear-attention block of qwen35.
//!
//! This is the shell around the delta rule. The rule itself lives in the
//! `deltarule` crate; everything here is the plumbing that produces its operands
//! and consumes its output.
//!
//! # The chain
//!
//! ```text
//! x = input_layernorm(h)                       (per-row RMSNorm, x*(1+w))
//! mixed = in_proj_qkv(x)                       [B, T, 2*key_dim + value_dim]
//! mixed = conv1d_silu(mixed)                   depthwise, causal, kernel 4
//! q, k, v = split(mixed, [key_dim, key_dim, value_dim])
//! q,k -> [B,T,num_k_heads,head_k_dim];  v -> [B,T,num_v_heads,head_v_dim]
//! z = in_proj_z(x) -> [B,T,num_v_heads,head_v_dim]
//! b = in_proj_b(x);  a = in_proj_a(x)          [B, T, num_v_heads]
//! beta = sigmoid(b)
//! g = -exp(A_log) * softplus(a + dt_bias)
//! q,k = repeat_interleave(q,k, num_v_heads/num_k_heads)   <- GQA, before the rule
//! out, state = delta_rule(q, k, v, g, beta)    [B,T,H,head_v_dim], [B,H,K,V]
//! out = norm(out, z)                           gated RMSNorm over head_v_dim
//! y = out_proj(out)
//! ```
//!
//! # Two conventions that are easy to get backwards
//!
//! * `input_layernorm` is `Qwen3_5RMSNorm`: **`x * (1 + w)`** with `w`
//!   zero-initialised, so the default is a no-op scale.
//! * `linear_attn.norm` is `Qwen3_5RMSNormGated`: **`w * x_hat * silu(z)`**, i.e.
//!   plain `w`, not `(1 + w)`. Using the wrong one of these zeroes every
//!   activation or doubles them, without raising an error.
//!
//! # Where the GQA expansion goes
//!
//! `repeat_interleave` on the head axis happens **before** the delta rule, so the
//! rule sees `num_v_heads`, not `num_k_heads`. The captured operands confirm it:
//! `q`/`k` are `[1, 6, 4, 16]` while `num_k_heads` is 2.

///
/// A naive `f32` accumulation of `n` products carries a worst-case error of about
/// `n * eps`, because every partial sum rounds. For the reductions in this model --
/// `n = 1024` for `hidden`, `3584` for `intermediate_size` -- that is a relative error
/// around `2e-4` and `8e-4`, and it is applied once per matmul across 24 layers.

/// error grows like `log n * eps`, roughly two orders of magnitude smaller here. So a
/// sequential loop is not "the same computation in different order" -- it is a
/// measurably worse one, and it shows up as the engine disagreeing with the reference
/// by several times the reference's own disagreement with itself.
///
/// Accumulating in `f64` removes the question: the products are exact (an `f32`
/// times an `f32` is representable in `f64`), and the sum of `n` of them in `f64`
/// carries an error of `n * eps_f64`, which is below `f32` resolution for any `n`
